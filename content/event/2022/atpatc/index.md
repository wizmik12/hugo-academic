event: Aquí te pillo, aquí te cuento
event_url: "https://scenio.es/aqui-te-pillo-aqui-te-cuento-i"

location: "Granada, Spain"

summary: "This talk explain the risks of automated decisions made by AI systems. In a one step closer to reliable models, it introduces probabilistic machine learning. These models not only give accurate predictions for decision-making but also a degree of confidence."
