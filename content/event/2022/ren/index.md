I collaborate with the European Project "Researchers' European Night" (HORIZON-MSCA-2022-CITIZENS-01 GA: 101061307) in Granada. 

I carried out 4 workshops together with my colleagues:

* The wisdom of the crowds: are many people smarter than a single expert?
* Artificial intelligence for the automatic generation of poems in Spanish
* How does an artificial intelligence system work?
* How does artificial intelligence detect cancer?
