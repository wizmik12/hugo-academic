Last year, I discovered my passion for comedy and public performance, which led me to explore various avenues for enhancing my communication skills and engaging with the general public. I took on the role of hosting the event 'Aquí te pillo, aquí te cuento,' generously supported by Granada's city hall. In this event, I not only delivered scientific talks but also entertained the audience with jokes and even some singing, despite my less-than-stellar vocal abilities. Singing, however, proved to be a fantastic way to connect with the audience, and I even had the opportunity to sing with a live band at the computer science school where I work.

In a different setting, I delved into the world of stand-up comedy, infusing my performances with a blend of science, reality, and humor to elicit laughter and learning simultaneously. Additionally, I explored the concept of improvisational science, participating in shows that combined scientific themes with improvisational comedy. It's been a tremendously enjoyable experience, and there's no doubt that my communication skills have significantly improved over the past year."
