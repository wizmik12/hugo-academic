Espacio3 aims to promote the relationship between science, technology, art, and society. It seeks to create a new platform for expression that merges science and theater in an unconventional way. The philosophy of this space is based on the convergence and synergy of different communication and expressive techniques: theater, improvisation, and discourse. Science and performing arts, such diverse domains, whose fusion allows for establishing new connections, seeking answers, and, certainly, posing new questions.
