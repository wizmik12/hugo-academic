I am Postdoctoral researcher working at the [CVBLab](https://www.cvblab.webs.upv.es/) of   Polytechnic University of Valencia (UPV). My main research lines are weakly supervised learning, Gaussian Processes and medical imaging. I finished my PhD in July of 2022. My thesis was about weakly supervised learning with Gaussian Processes applied to medical images. Now, my main focus is on crowdsourcing, explainability and uncertainty quantification for medical images. The PI of my research group is [Valery Naranjo](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=jk4XsG0AAAAJ&hl=en). I am very committed to science comunication.
